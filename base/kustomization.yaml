kind: Kustomization

# Base kustomization for Dorkomen Chart
# This serves as the foundation for environment-specific overlays.
#
# Usage:
#   Do not deploy this directly. Use an overlay instead:
#   - overlays/rancher-desktop  (local development)
#   - overlays/harvester        (Harvester HCI cluster)

resources: []

# The Helm chart is rendered via FluxCD HelmRelease, not kustomize directly.
# Overlays patch the values for environment-specific configuration.
